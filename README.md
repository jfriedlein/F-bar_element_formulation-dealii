# F-bar_element_formulation-dealii
Functions to implement volumetric locking-free elements using the F-bar element formulation in deal.II

will be documented soon together with a "how to use" code and maybe even some benchmarks, meanwhile you can check out selective reduced integration that also alleviates volumetric locking

# ToDo
update the code and the docu, also including the linearisation, what defoGrad to use when and 2D,3D,axisym
